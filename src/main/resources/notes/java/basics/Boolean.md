# Meet Booleans

The main new thing here is the `boolean` data type. You may think of them as light switches that can only be in one of two states: `true` or `false`. You can use them to represent things like: `true` (on) or `false` (off). They're perfect for representing things that have only two possible states.

Here, we declare a `boolean` variable named `isRaining` and set its value to `true`. This means, according to our program, "it is raining."

Similarly, we declare another `boolean` variable named `hasUmbrella` and set its value to `false`. This means, according to our program, "no, you don't have an umbrella."

When we use `System.out.println()` to display these variables (with String before that), we get the following output:

- `Is it raining? true`
- `Do you have an umbrella? false`

Booleans are fundamental in programming for making decisions, like "If `isRaining` is `true`, then take an umbrella" or "If `hasUmbrella` is `false`, then take shelter." You'll use them a lot to control the flow of your programs.
