# Polymorpism in OOP

This Java code beautifully illustrates **Polymorphism**, another cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming, which literally means "many forms." Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, while their specific behaviors are executed based on their actual type. This example showcases two key aspects of polymorphism: **method overriding** and **method overloading**.

**Method Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. In this code, the `Pet` class has a `makeSound()` method. Both the `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses **override** this method, providing their unique sound implementations (`barks` for `Dog` and `meows` for `Cat`). 

The `@Override` annotation is used to explicitly indicate that a method is intended to override a superclass method, helping the compiler catch errors if the override is incorrect. When `dog.makeSound()` or `cat.makeSound()` is called, the specific overridden version in `Dog` or `Cat` is executed, demonstrating polymorphism in action.

**Method Overloading** occurs within a single class when there are multiple methods with the same name but different **parameter lists** (different number, type, or order of parameters). The `Dog` class demonstrates this. It has the overridden `makeSound()` method (with no parameters) and an **overloaded** `makeSound(int volume)` method. 

The Java compiler determines which `makeSound` method to call based on the arguments provided during the method call. When `dog.makeSound(5)` is called, the overloaded version with an `int` parameter is invoked, allowing for a more nuanced "bark." This shows how methods can take on "many forms" within the same class, identified by their unique signatures.
