# Creating a Void Method

This Java code introduces a fundamental concept: a **`void` method**. A `void` method is essentially a block of code designed to perform a specific task, but it doesn't return any value after it finishes. Here, `displayMessage()` is a `void` method whose sole purpose is to print "Hello, world!" to the console. 

The `main` method, which is the entry point of the program, then **calls** `displayMessage()`. When `displayMessage()` is called, its code executes, and the message appears. Once `displayMessage()` completes its task, the program continues from where it left off in the `main` method.
