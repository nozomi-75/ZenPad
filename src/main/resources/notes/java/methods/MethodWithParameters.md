# Creating Methods with Parameters

This Java code demonstrates how to create and use methods that accept **parameters**, allowing them to perform actions based on specific input. The `greet` method takes a `String` parameter named `name`. When called, it uses this `name` to personalize a welcome message. The `printSum` method takes two `int` parameters, `num1` and `num2`.

It calculates their sum and then prints the result, showing how parameters can be used in computations. In the `main` method, both `greet` and `printSum` are **called**, with different values provided as arguments.
