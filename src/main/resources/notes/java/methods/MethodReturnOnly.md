# Creating a Method with a Return Value Only

This Java code demonstrates a simple but important use of a **method that returns a value**, specifically a `String`. The `getWelcomeMessage` method is designed to provide a fixed text message. It has a `String` as its return type, indicating that it will produce a string. 

Inside the method, it uses the `return` keyword to send the literal string "Code with syntax highlighting is lovely." back to the part of the program that called it. In the `main` method, `getWelcomeMessage()` is called directly within a `println` statement, meaning the string it returns is immediately printed to the console.
