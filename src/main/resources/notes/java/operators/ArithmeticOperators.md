## Arithmetic Operators

This program is a simple demonstration of **arithmetic operations** in Java. We start by setting up two whole numbers, **a** and **b**, with values of 8 and 4, respectively. Then, we perform five common mathematical operations:

As usual, we use the `+` and `-` symbols for addition and subtraction, respectively. On the other hand, we use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division.

**Modulus** (`%`) might be new for you! The modulus operator gives you the **remainder** after division. For example, if you divide 8 by 4, the remainder is 0. If you divided 9 by 4, the remainder would be 1.

For each operation, the result is stored in a new variable, and then the program displays the calculation and its answer on the screen. This helps us see exactly what the computer is doing!
