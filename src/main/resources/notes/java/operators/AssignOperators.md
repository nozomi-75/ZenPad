# Assignment Operators

This program demonstrates **assignment operators**. You can think of these as shortcuts for performing an arithmetic operation and then immediately saving the result back into the original variable.

We start with a variable named `number` and give it an initial value of 10. Then, we use several assignment operators. For example, the first assignment is a shorthand for saying "take the current value of `number`, add 5 to it, and then store the new result back into `number`." So, `number += 5` is the same as `number = number + 5`.

Following that logic, you have this order of operations; `(1)` 10 + 5 = 15; `(2)` 15 - 3 = 12; `(3)` 12 * 2 = 24; `(4)` 24 / 4 = 6; `(5)` 06 / 3 = 2 (no remainder).

Assignment operators makes things convenient in programming because they make your code shorter and easier to read, especially when you're frequently modifying the value of a variable. They are a convenient way to perform calculations and instantly update a variable in one concise step.
