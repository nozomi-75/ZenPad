# Relational Operators

This program uses **relational operators**. These operators don't do math like addition or subtraction; instead, they **compare** two values and tell you if a statement is `true` or `false`.

We set up two numbers, `a` (10) and `b` (20). Then, we use various relational operators to compare them. For each comparison, the program prints a question and then the answer, which will always be either `true` or `false`.

As you learn further, you may eventually rely on relational operators for making decisions in your code.
