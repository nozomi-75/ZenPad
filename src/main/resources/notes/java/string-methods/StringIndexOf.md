# String `indexOf()` method

This Java code demonstrates various ways to use the **`indexOf()` method** to find the position of characters or substrings within a larger string. The `indexOf()` method is quite flexible. When you search for a single character, like 'J', it returns the **index of the first occurrence** of that character. 

Similarly, when searching for a `String` like "Java", it gives you the starting index of the first time that sequence of characters appears. You can also specify a **starting index** for the search, which is useful for finding subsequent occurrences of the same character or string. If the character or substring isn't found at all, `indexOf()` will return `-1`.
