# String `replace()` method

This Java code demonstrates how to use the **`replace()` method** to substitute characters or substrings within a string. It starts with an `original` sentence. The `replace()` method is quite flexible: you can use it to replace all occurrences of a specific **substring** (like changing "fox" to "cat"), or to replace all occurrences of a single **character** (like changing every 'o' to an '*'). 

It's important to understand that `replace()` does not modify the original string; instead, it returns a **new string** with the replacements made. The original string remains unchanged.
