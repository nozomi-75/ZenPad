# Change case of characters in a String

This Java code demonstrates how to easily change the **case of characters within a string** using built-in string methods. It starts with a string containing a mix of upper and lower case letters. 

The `toUpperCase()` method is then called on this string, which creates and returns a **new string** where all alphabetic characters from the original are converted to uppercase. 

Similarly, the `toLowerCase()` method is used to generate another new string with all alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
