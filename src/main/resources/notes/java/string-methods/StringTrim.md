# String `trim()` method

This Java code illustrates how to use the **`trim()` method** to remove unwanted whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. It starts with a `messyString` that has spaces at both ends and another `noWhitespaceString` that's already clean. The `trim()` method is then called on both strings. What `trim()` does is create and return a **new string** where any leading or trailing whitespace characters (like spaces, tabs, or newlines) have been removed. 

It's important to remember that `trim()` only affects whitespace at the *extremes* of the string; any spaces *within* the string's content remain untouched. Also, it does not modify the original string, always producing a new one.
