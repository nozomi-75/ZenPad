# String `equals()` method

This Java code provides a crucial demonstration of how to correctly **compare the content of strings** using the **`equals()` method**, and contrasts it with the pitfalls of using the `==` operator. Several strings are initialized, including `strD` which is created using `new String()`, guaranteeing it's a different object in memory even if its content is the same. The `equals()` method accurately compares the actual sequence of characters in the strings. So, `strA.equals(strB)` and `strA.equals(strD)` both return `true` because their contents are identical.

In stark contrast, the `==` operator compares **object references** (whether two variables point to the *exact same object* in memory). This is why `strA == strB` might be `true` due to string interning (where identical string literals often point to the same object), but `strA == strD` is `false` because `strD` is a distinct object, even with the same content.
