# String `isEmpty()` method

This Java code illustrates how to use the **`isEmpty()` method** to check if a string contains any characters. It sets up three different strings: one with content, one that's completely empty, and one with only whitespace characters. The `isEmpty()` method is then called on each of these strings. 

It's important to note that `isEmpty()` returns `true` *only* if the string has a length of zero, meaning it contains no characters at all. It does not consider strings with just spaces or tabs as empty.
