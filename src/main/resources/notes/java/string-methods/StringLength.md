# String `length()` method

This Java code provides a simple illustration of how to determine the **length of a string** using the built-in `length()` method. A `String` variable named `str` is initialized with a sample sentence. The core of this example is the line `int length = str.length();`, which calls the `length()` method on the `str` object. 

This method returns the total number of characters in the string, including spaces and punctuation. Finally, both the original string and its calculated length are printed to the console.
