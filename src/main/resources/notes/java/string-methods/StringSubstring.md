# String `substring()` method

This Java code demonstrates how to extract portions of a string using the versatile **`substring()` method**. It starts with a `greeting` string. The `substring()` method can be used in a couple of ways. When given a **single argument**, like `greeting.substring(5)`, it creates a new string that begins at the specified index (inclusive) and goes all the way to the end of the original string. 

When provided with **two arguments**, for example, `greeting.substring(0, 4)`, it extracts characters starting from the first index (inclusive) up to, but *not including*, the second index (exclusive). This method is fundamental for manipulating and parsing parts of strings.
