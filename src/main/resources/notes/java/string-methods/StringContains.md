# String `contains()` method

This Java code demonstrates how to check if a string **contains** a specific sequence of characters using the `contains()` method. A `paragraph` string is defined. The `contains()` method is then used to see if this paragraph includes the substring "Java", "HTML", and "java" (with a lowercase 'j'). 

It's important to note that the `contains()` method performs a **case-sensitive** check. This means "Java" is considered different from "java".
