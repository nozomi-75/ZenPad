# Nested Loops

This program features nested loops, which means one loop is placed inside another loop. You can think of it like a clock: the hour hand (representing the outer loop) moves slowly, and for every single move it makes, the minute hand (the inner loop) completes a full rotation. In this example, the outer loop controls the main repetitions, starting with `i` at 1 and continuing as long as `i` is less than or equal to 2. For each value of `i`, the code inside its curly braces executes.

Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that is completely contained within it. Every time the outer loop runs once, the inner loop runs completely through all its repetitions, starting with `j` at 1 and continuing as long as `j` is less than or equal to 3.

It's also important to note that you can nest any type of loop within another loop. For example, you could have a `while` loop inside a `for` loop, or a `do-while` loop inside a `while` loop, depending on the specific logic your program requires. This flexibility allows for very powerful and complex repetitive operations.
