# The Do-while Loop

The **do-while loop** is a fundamental programming construct that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly. What makes the `do-while loop` special is that it guarantees the code inside the loop will run at least once, even if the condition for repeating isnâ€™t met right away.

In this program, we start with a variable called `count`, which is initially set to 1. The program enters the `do` block, and the code inside this block always runs first. It prints "Count is: " followed by the current value of `count`, and then increases `count` by 1. After executing the `do` block, the program checks the condition `while (count <= 5)`. If the value of `count` is less than or equal to 5, the loop repeats: it prints the current count, increments the value, and checks the condition again. 

This process continues until count becomes 6. At that point, the condition `count <= 5` is no longer true, so the loop stops. The program then moves on to the next line after the loop and prints "Done counting!" This demonstrates how a `do-while` loop ensures that the code inside the loop is executed at least once, regardless of the initial condition.
