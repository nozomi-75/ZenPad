# For-Each Loop

This Java code showcases the **enhanced `for` loop**, often called the **`for-each` loop** which provides a more concise and readable way to iterate over arrays compared to the traditional `for` loop demonstrated in `ThroughFor`. While `ThroughFor` required managing an index variable (`i`) and using the array's `length` property to control iteration, this `ForEach` example simplifies the process. 

Here, `for (String fruit : fruits)` directly reads as "for each `String` named `fruit` in the `fruits` array." This eliminates the need for manual index tracking, making the code less prone to off-by-one errors and generally more intuitive for simply processing every element in a collection without needing its index.
