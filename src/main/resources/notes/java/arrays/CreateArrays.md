# Creating an Array in Java

This Java program demonstrates the fundamental process of **declaring, instantiating, and initializing a one-dimensional array** of integers. It first declares `myIntArray` as a variable that can hold an array of integers. Then, it **instantiates** the array, allocating memory for five integer elements. 

Following this, individual elements of the array are **initialized** by assigning specific integer values to each position, accessed by their **index** (starting from 0). Finally, the code demonstrates how to **access and print specific elements** from the array using their respective indices.
