# Array Length Property

This Java code demonstrates how to iterate through an array using a traditional `for` loop, specifically highlighting the utility of the **`.length` property**. An array named `cars` is initialized with three string elements. The `for` loop's condition, `i < cars.length`, is crucial here. 

Instead of hardcoding the array size, `cars.length` dynamically provides the number of elements in the `cars` array. This makes the loop adaptable; if more car names are added to the array, the loop will automatically adjust to iterate through all of them without needing manual code changes. Inside the loop, each car's name is accessed using its index `i` and printed to the console.
