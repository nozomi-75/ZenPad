# Finding the Sum of a Matrix

This Java code concisely calculates the sum of all elements within a **two-dimensional array**, often referred to as a **matrix**. It initializes a matrix with predefined integer values and a variable to store the accumulating sum. 

The program then efficiently traverses the matrix using **enhanced for loops**. The outer loop iterates through each **row** of the matrix, while the inner loop processes each individual **number** within that row, adding it to the running `sum`. Finally, the total sum of all matrix elements is printed to the console.
