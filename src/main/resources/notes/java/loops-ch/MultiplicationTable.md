# Multiplication Table

This Java code generates a standard **multiplication table** up to 10x10. It uses nested **`for` loops**: the **outer loop** represents the first number in the multiplication (from 1 to 10), and the **inner loop** represents the second number (also from 1 to 10). 

Inside the inner loop, the product of the two loop counters is calculated and printed, followed by a tab for neat spacing. After each row of the multiplication table is completed by the inner loop, `System.out.println()` moves the output to the next line, ensuring the table is displayed in a clear, row-by-row format.
