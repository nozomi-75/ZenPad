# Printing Cartesian Coordinates

This Java code systematically generates and prints **Cartesian coordinates** within a defined grid. It uses two **nested loops** to achieve this. The outer loop controls the **x-coordinate**, iterating through values from 1 to 5. Similarly, the inner loop manages the **y-coordinate**, also iterating from 1 to 5 for each `x` value.

Inside the inner loop, the current `(x, y)` coordinate pair is formatted and printed. After all `y` values for a given `x` are processed, the code moves to a new line, effectively creating a grid-like output of coordinate pairs. This pattern demonstrates how loops can be used to explore and represent two-dimensional spaces.
