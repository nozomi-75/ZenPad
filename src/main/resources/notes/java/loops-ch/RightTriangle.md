# Right Triangle

This Java code constructs a **right-aligned triangle** made of asterisks. It begins by establishing the desired number of rows for the triangle. The core of the program involves two **nested loops**. The outer loop iterates through each row, from the first row up to the specified total. 

The inner loop is responsible for printing the asterisks within each individual row. Its condition ensures that the number of asterisks printed in each subsequent row increases by one, forming the triangular pattern. After all the asterisks for a given row have been printed, the code moves to the next line, preparing for the creation of the subsequent row.
