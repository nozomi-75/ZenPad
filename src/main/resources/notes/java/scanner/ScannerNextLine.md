# Scanner `nextLine()` method

This Java code demonstrates how to read an **entire line of text input from the user**, including spaces, using the `Scanner` class. After creating a `Scanner` object linked to standard input, the program prompts the user for their full name. The key here is the `input.nextLine()` method. 

Unlike `next()`, which reads only up to the next whitespace, `nextLine()` reads all characters until it encounters a line separator (like pressing Enter), consuming the entire line. This allows the program to capture a full name that includes spaces.
