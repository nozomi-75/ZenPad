# Hello World

```java
public class HelloWorld { ... }
```

In Java, everything we write is put inside something called a "class." You can think of a class as a blueprint or a container for all our instructions. It's like a special box where we put all the pieces of our program.

```java
public void main(String[] args) { ... }
```

This line looks a bit scary, but it's super important! This is the starting point of your program. When you tell your computer to "run" your Java code, it immediately looks for this exact line.  The other words are important for how Java works under the hood, but for now, just remember that they are part of the standard way to write the starting point of your program. You'll learn what they mean specifically as you get more comfortable with Java.

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

`System` refers to the main system of your computer. `out` means that we want to output something, like sending information out. `println` stands for "print line." It means print whatever we tell it, and the move to the next line (like hitting Enter on your keyboard).

`Hello World!` is the message we want to print. Notice how it's inside double quotes. That's because it's a String, which is just a fancy word for a bunch of characters. This tells Java that it's a String that should be printed exactly as it is.

So `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` is like saying "Hey, computer, print out the words 'Hello, World!' and then move to the next line." It's a simple way to print out a message to the user.
