# Data Types in Python

When you write a program, you often need to store informationâ€”like a name, a number, or a true/false value. In Python, you use **variables** to do this. You can think of a variable as a labeled box where you keep a piece of information you want to use later.

Here are some common types of information (called **data types**) you might store:

**Strings**: These are pieces of text, like names or messages. In Python, you put text inside quotes. For example, a person's name is a string.

**Integers**: These are whole numbers, like 12 or 3456. You use them for things like counting or numbering.

**Floats**: These are numbers with a decimal point, like 2.5 or 150000.75. Use them when you need to keep track of things like money or measurements that aren't whole numbers.

**Booleans**: These are special values that can only be `True` or `False`. They are useful for keeping track of whether something is active, finished, or meets a certain condition.

You give each variable a name so you can use it later in your program. For example, you might have a variable for a person's name, another for their account balance, and another to show if the account is active.

Once you've stored your information in variables, you can use the `print()` command to display it on the screen. This is a great way to check what's in your variables or to show information to someone using your program.

**Tip:**  
If you want to show both text and a number together, Python will automatically handle this if you separate them with commas in `print()`. If you want to join them together as one piece of text, you may need to convert the number to a string using the `str()` function.
