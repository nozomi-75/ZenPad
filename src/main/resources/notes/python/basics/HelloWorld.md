# Hello, World!

This is a basic example of a **Python** program. Think of a program as a set of instructions you give to a computer.

The first line is an example of a Python comment. The `#` symbol tells Python to ignore everything after it on that line. This is a **comment**, and programmers use them to leave notes for themselves (or other people) to explain what the code does. The computer just skips over these.

The second line is an instruction that tells Python to do something specific. The `print()` part is a built-in command that makes Python display whatever is inside the parentheses `()` on your screen.

In this case, it will show the words "Hello, World!" The text inside the double quotes `""` is what we call a **string**, which is just a sequence of characters.
