# Data Types in C

In programming, you often need to store different kinds of information, such as names, numbers, or single characters. To do this, you use **variables**. Think of a variable as a labeled container that holds a value you want to use in your program.

Here are some common data types you might see in a C program:

**char**: Used for single characters, like 'S' for a type of account.

**char arrays**: This is usually referred to as string in other languages. It is used for text, such as a person's name. In C, text is stored as an array of characters.

**signed char, short, int, long**: These are all types of whole numbers, but they can store different ranges of values. For example, `int` is used for most numbers, while `short` and `long` are for smaller or larger numbers.

**float, double**: These are numbers with decimal points. `float` is for less precise values, while `double` can store more precise numbers, such as account balances.

Each variable in C must be given a type when you create it, so the computer knows how much space to set aside and how to interpret the value.
