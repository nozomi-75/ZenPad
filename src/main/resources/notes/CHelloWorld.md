# Hello, World!

When you start learning C, one of the first programs you'll write is called "Hello World." This simple program shows you how to make the computer display a message on the screen.

Comments: Anything after `//` on a line is a comment. Comments are notes for you or other programmers. The computer ignores them.

`#include <stdio.h>`: This line tells the computer to use a set of standard commands for input and output, like printing text.

`int main() { ... }`: Every C program starts running from the `main` function. The curly braces `{}` show where the main part of your program begins and ends.

`printf("Hello World!");`: This command prints the words "Hello World!" on the screen. The text you want to show goes inside the quotes.

`return 0;`: This line tells the computer that the program finished successfully.

Each line in C usually ends with a semicolon `;`.
